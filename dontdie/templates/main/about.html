        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Don't Die is a social platform designed to help people share meaningful messages with their friends and family - 
            the things they'd want them to know if they were no longer here. Our mission is to create a space for authentic 
            connection and to remind people how much they matter.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Why We Created This</h3>
        <p>
            Too often, we save our most heartfelt words for eulogies - when the person who needs to hear them most is gone. 
            Don't Die flips this concept by encouraging "pre-eulogies" - tributes shared during life, when they can truly make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            When someone is struggling with depression or thoughts of suicide, knowing how valued they are by their loved ones 
            can provide critical perspective and hope. By reading tributes from friends and family when they're feeling low, 
            people can be reminded of their importance and the meaningful connections in their life.
        </p>
