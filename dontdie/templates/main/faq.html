                        <p>Don't Die is a social platform designed to help people share meaningful messages with their friends and family - the things they'd want them to know if they were no longer here. It's a space for authentic connection and to remind people how much they matter.</p>
                        <p>We call these messages "tributes" - they're like pre-eulogies that can be shared with people while they're still alive, when the words can truly make a difference.</p>

                        <p>Too often, we save our most heartfelt words for eulogies - when the person who needs to hear them most is gone. Don't Die flips this concept by encouraging people to share these meaningful messages during life.</p>
                        <p>When someone is struggling with depression or thoughts of suicide, knowing how valued they are by their loved ones can provide critical perspective and hope.</p>
                        <p>Even for those not experiencing crisis, receiving the gift of knowing how much you matter to someone can be profoundly moving and strengthen your relationships.</p>

                        <p>No. Don't Die is built on the principle of authenticity. All accounts must use real identities, and all tributes are connected to the author who wrote them.</p>
